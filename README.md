# ComicStore-Admin_Page
You are set with the task of building a comic store administration portal for a mock client called ComicStock. You have to build the front end with Angular 4 for a restful  web API

Guide
You need to build the Angular 4.x front end for the ComicStock API that the ComicStock back-end engineers have painstakingly put together for you (overnight).

The required functionality is:

A user should be able to view paginated list all of the system's Suppliers.
A user should be able to create new suppliers, edit existing ones.
A user should be prompted for confirmation before they remove a supplier from the system.
A user should be able to easily search through all of the Suppliers.
A user should be able to view a selection of issues, including the comic's image.
A user should be able to place an order for issues of various grades of quality from a chosen supplier.

You have free reign over the design, layout, and look & feel of the portal. So make is sassy!
We would recommend using something simple and well known like Bootstrap for the styling.
